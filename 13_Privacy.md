# Privacy

The creator of this contract was careful enough to protect the sensitive areas of its storage.

Unlock this contract to beat the level.

Things that might help:

- Understanding how storage works
- Understanding how parameter parsing works
- Understanding how casting works

Tips:

Remember that metamask is just a commodity. Use another tool if it is presenting problems. Advanced gameplay could involve using remix, or your own web3 provider.

## Solution


The password stored in byte16(data[2]) that is the 6th storage location. to get that run the following code in the console
- `await web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address, 5)`

the above code will gie you a byte32 value, take the first 16 bytes and provide it as the input to the unlock function.



### Hint from Ethernaut
Nothing in the ethereum blockchain is private. The keyword private is merely an artificial construct of the Solidity language. Web3's getStorageAt(...) can be used to read anything from storage. It can be tricky to read what you want though, since several optimization rules and techniques are used to compact the storage as much as possible.

It can't get much more complicated than what was exposed in this level.
